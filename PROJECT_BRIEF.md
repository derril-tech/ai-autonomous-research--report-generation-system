# THE PROJECT BRIEF #

# Project Name #
Autonomous Research & Report Generation System

# Product Description / Presentation #
The Autonomous Research & Report Generation System is an AI-powered platform designed to automate research workflows, analyze large datasets, and generate actionable insights and reports. By combining advanced natural language understanding with data analytics, the system empowers businesses, researchers, and analysts to accelerate knowledge discovery and decision-making. Key features include automated literature review, intelligent data synthesis, customizable reporting templates, real-time collaboration, and multi-source data integration. Professionals and teams love it because it transforms time-consuming manual research into efficient, accurate, and scalable AI-assisted workflows.
Framework (and why)
We use LangChain + FastAPI as the orchestration backbone. LangChain enables modular AI workflows (retrieval, reasoning, report generation), while FastAPI ensures a scalable, secure backend with async support. Claude is leveraged for advanced reasoning tasks, GPT-4 for structured generation, and pgvector for semantic search. This hybrid approach ensures research tasks are accurate, explainable, and production-ready.

FOLLOW THIS 8 STEP PLAN TO PREPARE THE INFRASTRUCTURE
-----------------------------------------------------

# ðŸš€ Claude Fullstack Repo Prep â€“ Optimized 8 Step Plan

  
The goal: build an extensive frontend + backend scaffold so Claude Code only has to finish ~20% of the work.  
Each step must be **completed and reviewed** before advancing.
IMPORTANT: the checklist in each step has be checked off 100% before moving to the next step

---

## STEP 1 â€” Build the Rich Infrastructure
Create a **deep scaffold** for both frontend and backend so Claude code can recognize the architecture immediately.

- Build a **frontend app shell** with routing, placeholder pages, components, and styling setup.  
- Build a **backend app shell** with API structure, health endpoint, and config in place.  
- Include `REPO_MAP.md`, `API_SPEC.md`, and a draft `CLAUDE.md` in the `docs/` folder.  (create the docs folder if it does not exist)
- Add **TODO markers and folder-level `_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** files so Claude knows exactly where to add logic.

**Deliverables**
- Frontend app shell with routing, placeholder pages, components, and styling setup  
- Backend app shell with API structure, health endpoint, and config  
- `docs/REPO_MAP.md`, `docs/API_SPEC.md` (stub), and draft `docs/CLAUDE.md`  
- TODO markers + folder-level `_INSTRUCTIONS.md` files  

**Checklist**
- [ ] Frontend scaffold compiles (`npm run dev`)  
- [ ] Backend boots (`uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload`)  
- [ ] Docs folder created with drafts (`REPO_MAP.md`, `API_SPEC.md`, `CLAUDE.md`)  
- [ ] TODO markers and `_INSTRUCTIONS.md` stubs in place  


---

## STEP 2 â€” Enrich the Scaffold
If the repo looks shallow, enrich it so Claude needs fewer leaps of imagination.  

Add:
- Sample frontend routes and components (`/`, `/about`, `/dashboard`)  
- Domain model stubs and types/interfaces  
- Mock data + fixtures for UI flows  
- README files with quick run instructions for both frontend and backend  
- Instructions embedded in folders (e.g. `CLAUDE_TASK: â€¦`)

**Deliverables**
- Sample routes and pages (`/`, `/about`, `/dashboard`)  
- Domain model stubs and type definitions  
- Mock data and fixtures for UI flows  
- README files for frontend and backend with run instructions  
- Folder-level instructions (`_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)  

**Checklist**
- [ ] At least 2â€“3 sample routes/pages exist  
- [ ] Domain types/interfaces stubbed out  
- [ ] Mock data + fixtures included  
- [ ] README_FRONTEND.md and README_BACKEND.md added  
- [ ] Each folder has `_INSTRUCTIONS.md` where relevant 

---

## STEP 3 â€” Audit for Alignment
Check that the scaffold actually matches the product brief, tech specs, and UX goals.
Add additional UI/UX elements (if needed) to make the application visually appealing (and update the design requirements after that)

- Do navigation and pages reflect the productâ€™s main flows?  
- Do API endpoints match the UI needs?  
- Is the chosen tech stack consistent (no unused or conflicting libraries)?  
- Is the UX direction reflected (design tokens, layout, component stubs)?

**Deliverables**
- Alignment review across Product â†” UI/UX â†” Tech  
- Identify any missing flows, mismatched libraries, or conflicting instructions  

**Checklist**
- [ ] Navigation structure matches product journeys  
- [ ] Components/pages map to required features  
- [ ] API endpoints cover MVP needs  
- [ ] No contradictory or unused technologies  


---

## STEP 4 â€” Document the Architecture
Now make the docs **Claude-ready**:

- **REPO_MAP.md**: Full repo breakdown with roles of each folder  
- **API_SPEC.md**: Endpoints, payloads, error handling  
- **CLAUDE.md**: Editing rules, coding conventions, AI collaboration guidelines  

These three files are the **context backbone** Claude will use to understand the repo.

**Deliverables**
- `REPO_MAP.md`: full repo breakdown with folder purposes  
- `API_SPEC.md`: endpoints, models, error conventions  
- `CLAUDE.md`: collaboration rules, editing boundaries  

**Checklist**
- [ ] REPO_MAP.md fully describes structure  
- [ ] API_SPEC.md covers all MVP endpoints and schemas  
- [ ] CLAUDE.md includes project overview, editing rules, examples  


---

## STEP 5 â€” Improve the Prompt
Enhance the prompt (in `docs/PROMPT_DECLARATION.md`) with details Claude needs:

- FE/BE boundaries and data contracts  
- UX guidelines (states, accessibility, interaction patterns)  
- Performance budgets (bundle size, API latency)  
- Security constraints (auth, rate limits, PII handling)  
- Testing expectations (unit, integration, end-to-end)

**Deliverables**
- FE/BE boundaries and contracts  
- UX guidelines (states, accessibility, patterns)

**Checklist**
- [ ] Prompt includes FE/BE division of responsibility  
- [ ] UX principles and design tokens specified  
- [ ] Performance/security/testing requirements added  
- [ ] Prompt is concrete and actionable for Claude  

---

## STEP 6 â€” Expert Audit of the Prompt
Now do a **meticulous audit** of the one-page prompt declaration.

- Double-check frontend and backend folders are ready  
- Confirm editing boundaries are clear (what Claude can/canâ€™t touch)  
- Make the declaration **battle-tested and handoff-ready**

**Deliverables**
- Remove inconsistencies/duplicates  
- Ensure stack â†” product â†” scaffold alignment  
- Add UI/UX and accessibility details  
- Clarify file boundaries (editable vs do-not-touch)  
- Confirm prompt uses Claude-friendly syntax  

**Checklist**
- [ ] No unused or contradictory tech remains  
- [ ] UI/UX directives are product-specific and sufficient  
- [ ] Editing boundaries explicitly defined  
- [ ] Prompt syntax uses clear, imperative instructions  


---

## STEP 7 â€” Birdâ€™s-Eye Repo Review
Do a quick top-level scan for missing pieces:

- All folders contain either code or `_INSTRUCTIONS.md`  
- `.env.example` files exist for both frontend and backend  
- CI/CD config is present and not trivially broken  
- Run scripts (`npm run dev`, `uvicorn â€¦`) work end-to-end  
- No orphan TODOs without clear ownership

**Deliverables**
- Verify all core files exist  
- Confirm environment, CI, and scripts work end-to-end  

**Checklist**

**Checklist**
- [x] Every folder has code or `_INSTRUCTIONS.md`  
- [x] `.env.example` present for both frontend and backend  
- [x] CI pipeline triggers and passes basic checks  
- [x] Dev script (`scripts/dev.sh`) runs both FE and BE  

---

## STEP 8 â€” Finalize CLAUDE.md
This is where Claude gets its **onboarding pack**. Make sure `CLAUDE.md` includes:

- **Project Overview**: one-paragraph purpose, stack, goals, target users  
- **Folder & File Structure**: whatâ€™s editable vs do-not-touch  
- **Coding Conventions**: style guides, naming rules, commenting expectations  
- **AI Collaboration Rules**: response format, edit rules, ambiguity handling  
- **Editing Rules**: full-file vs patches, locked files  
- **Dependencies & Setup**: frameworks, services, env vars  
- **Workflow & Tools**: how to run locally, FE/BE boundary, deployment notes  
- **Contextual Knowledge**: product quirks, domain rules, business logic caveats  
- **Examples**: good vs bad AI answer

**Deliverables**
- Project overview (purpose, stack, goals, users)
