# Frontend Quick Start

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`

## Structure
- pages/: Next.js routes (Home, About, Dashboard)
- components/: React components (domain stubs, mock data)
- styles/: Tailwind CSS
- utils/: helpers

## TODO
- Implement routing, pages, and UI components as per project brief.
- Ensure at least 2â€“3 sample routes/pages exist.
- Add domain model stubs and mock data for UI flows.

## Alignment Review (STEP 3)
- Navigation matches product journeys
- Components/pages map to required features
- Tech stack is consistent and matches requirements
