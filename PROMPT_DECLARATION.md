AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH & REPORT GENERATION SYSTEM

PROJECT SPECIFICATION


CRITICAL PROMPTS FOR CLAUDE

PROMPT 1: PROJECT SETUP & ARCHITECTURE
"Set up the complete project architecture using the prebuilt stack. Configure Next.js 14 frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind, FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM + JWT, PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis caching, and deployment files. Ensure folder structure and configs extend the prebuilt architecture."

PROMPT 2: CORE BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION
"Extend the FastAPI backend with research-specific functionality. Add async SQLAlchemy models, JWT authentication, Claude + GPT-4 integrations through LangChain, RESTful API endpoints for research workflows, WebSocket endpoints for real-time collaboration, and robust error handling/logging. Build on the existing base."

PROMPT 3: FRONTEND COMPONENTS & UI
"Develop Next.js 14 frontend components extending the prebuilt architecture. Create research dashboards, AI-assisted report editors, file upload interface, real-time update views, and ensure WCAG compliance. Implement responsive Tailwind CSS with dark/light themes."

PROMPT 4: AI INTEGRATION & FEATURES
"Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 and Claude for autonomous research. Build workflows for literature review, data analysis, and report generation. Implement cloud file handling, email notifications, and connect outputs seamlessly with the frontend. Extend current system capabilities without breaking architecture."

PROMPT 5: DEPLOYMENT & OPTIMIZATION
"Finalize deployment configs for Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend). Optimize database queries, cache strategies, and API performance for sub-2s response times. Add testing (unit, integration, e2e), security best practices, and OpenAPI documentation. Ensure it integrates cleanly with prebuilt base and runs end-to-end."
