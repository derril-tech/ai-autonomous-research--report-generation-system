AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH & REPORT GENERATION SYSTEM

PROJECT SPECIFICATION

CRITICAL PROMPTS FOR CLAUDE

PROMPT 1: PROJECT SETUP & ARCHITECTURE
"Set up the complete project architecture using the prebuilt stack. Configure Next.js 14 frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind, FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM + JWT, PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis caching, and deployment files. Ensure folder structure and configs extend the prebuilt architecture."

PROMPT 2: CORE BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION
"Extend the FastAPI backend with research-specific functionality. Add async SQLAlchemy models, JWT authentication, Claude + GPT-4 integrations through LangChain, RESTful API endpoints for research workflows, WebSocket endpoints for real-time collaboration, and robust error handling/logging. Build on the existing base."

PROMPT 3: FRONTEND COMPONENTS & UI
"Develop Next.js 14 frontend components extending the prebuilt architecture. Create research dashboards, AI-assisted report editors, file upload interface, real-time update views, and ensure WCAG compliance. Implement responsive Tailwind CSS with dark/light themes."

PROMPT 4: AI INTEGRATION & FEATURES
"Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 and Claude for autonomous research. Build workflows for literature review, data analysis, and report generation. Implement cloud file handling, email notifications, and connect outputs seamlessly with the frontend. Extend current system capabilities without breaking architecture."

PROMPT 5: DEPLOYMENT & OPTIMIZATION
"Finalize deployment configs for Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend). Optimize database queries, cache strategies, and API performance for sub-2s response times. Add testing (unit, integration, e2e), security best practices, and OpenAPI documentation. Ensure it integrates cleanly with prebuilt base and runs end-to-end."

# Claude-Optimized Modular Prompt Declaration

**System Prompt:**
You are an expert Fullstack Software Developer specializing in Next.js 14 and React 18. Your task is to generate clean, reusable, and production-ready code based on the user's detailed specification. All code must be mobile-first, follow accessibility best practices, and adhere to a component-based architecture.

**Instructions:**
1. Implement all features and requirements as described in the technical specification below.
2. Use strict TypeScript typing, modern React hooks, and contexts for frontend.
3. Use FastAPI with async SQLAlchemy, modular routers, and JWT authentication for backend.
4. Integrate LangChain, Claude, and GPT-4 for AI workflows.
5. Ensure all components are modular, reusable, and documented.
6. Apply Tailwind CSS for styling, with purple (#6B46C1) and yellow (#F6E05E) accents.
7. Implement real-time collaboration and WebSocket features.
8. Ensure security, compliance, and testing coverage.

- States: loading, error, success, editing, saving, AI suggestions
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast
- Interaction patterns: real-time collaboration, inline AI suggestions, mobile-first design
- Design tokens: purple (#6B46C1), yellow (#F6E05E), rounded corners, shadow, spacing

## Performance Budgets
- Bundle size: < 500KB for initial load
- API latency: < 2 seconds for research workflows

## Security Constraints
- Auth: JWT-based authentication, refresh tokens, RBAC
- Rate limits: API endpoints protected against abuse
- PII handling: Secure storage, encrypted at rest and in transit

## Testing Expectations
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for both frontend and backend
- >90% test coverage
- CI pipeline required

## Expert Audit (STEP 6)

## Checklist

Let's think step by step to translate the requirements into a modular, production-ready codebase, ensuring each component is self-contained and the data flow is logical.
